# FuriganaToImageChrome
Chrome extension to convert text to an image, which can be exported to the clipboard. 


## Objective
The initial purpose of this extension is to make it easier to create support texts for language-learning purposes. 
It was inspired by a Japanese teacher who needed help when writing in Furigana (Japanese kanji with its pronunciation on top), as most online text editors do not allow writing in this format. It can, however, help when learning other languages, as this extension can be used to show the pronunciation or meaning of words in most computer-accepted text formats.
