# FuriganaToImageChrome
Chrome extension to convert text to an image, which can be exported to the clipboard. 


## Objective
The initial purpose of this extension was to make it easier to create support texts for language-learning purposes. 
It was inspired by a Japanese teacher who needed help when writing in Furigana (Japanese kanji with its pronunciation on top).
